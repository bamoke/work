                        <p>Extract from China News</p>
                        <p>“... The Venice Biennale of Architecture was first held in 1980 and is one of the most influential
                            international events in architectural arts and academia, providing an important communication
                            platform for architecture and for cultural exchanges. Since 2014, the IC has twice organised
                            the participation of local architects in this great event. This year, IC strives once again to
                            present projects by Macao architects in the international arena... Following a meticulous assessment
                            of the eight projects for the biennale pre-selected by the Architects Association of Macau, the
                            jury selected the project curated by Lam Manuel Lap Yan and authored by architects Ieong Chong
                            Tat, Vong Ka Ian and Chu Hou San, who will thus represent Macao at the 16th Venice Biennale of
                            Architecture. The architects of the selected team have an average age of 30 and are all registered
                            architects in Macao.</p>
                        <p>The 16th Venice Biennale of Architecture takes 'Freespace' as theme, comprising concepts, time and
                            memories of freedom, connecting the past, present and future. On the basis of inherited culture,
                            the ancient and modern are woven together.</p>
                        <p>In order to align with the theme, the selected team purposely chose 'cards', a symbol of Macao's
                            swift economic development, as the core element of their project. Through different combinations
                            and formats of the 'cards' and abstract techniques, they reveal constructions rich in local characteristics
                            that have a close connection to residents, such as markets, gardens and stairways, among others.
                            In the process of exploration and reconstruction, one is able to re-experience the local space,
                            reflect on the harmonious relationship between people and space, challenge plans and the limits
                            of autonomy and explore an interactive balance.</p>
                        <p>The jury considered that the selected project drew on the characteristics of Macau and incorporated
                            elements of cultural value, revealing an image of Macau in a perceptual manner and displaying
                            the traditional in a new way, having therefore a great deal of interest and unity. The winning
                            team was further considered worthy of being the one selected, as it revealed considerable maturity
                            in terms of architectural language and representation and was also able to highlight Macao's
                            cultural characteristics.”</p>
